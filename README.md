# Boids

An implementation of the boids algorithm/idea as specified here:  https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/

# How to run
Nothing special needed just run targeting the BoidsSimulation class after compiling. 

Make sure a recent version of java is installed 

# Main ideas in implementation
Most of this will be reiterating what is said in the link above.

Cohesion: Tendency of boids to staty close together.
Seperation: Tendency of boids to keep distance between each other.
Alignment: Tendency of boids to point in similiar direction.

Boids that are close to each other will keep in mind the above three principles. This creates a herding/flocking affect that looks like a school of fish.


# Final thoughts
There is no current implementation to allow this but changing many of the values in the source code can create very cool effects.
There is a lot to learn from even turning off some of the principles above and mixing and matching them.

#  Processing
The visual tools used to draw to the screen were created by the processing foundation.
